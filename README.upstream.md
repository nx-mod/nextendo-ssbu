## What is this?

The NEX game server for **Super Smash Bros. Ultimate** on [Nextendo Network](https://nextendo.network):
authentication, matchmaking, NAT traversal, and the online-init handlers (DataStore `0x73` /
Utility `0x6E`) that bring SSBU's online mode up. Built on the
[**nextendo-nex**](https://github.com/NextendoNetwork/nextendo-nex) core.

> **DataStore / Utility init is a stub.** SSBU calls a set of DataStore and Utility getters during
> the online bring-up. This server answers them with a minimal valid response (empty list) so the
> game proceeds; a full server-side implementation is not yet part of this tree, so online play is
> not complete out of the box.

## Running
